### Objective
+ Examine Key Metrics of Operational Performance: Evaluate fundamental performance indicators such as RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), Occupancy Rate, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and Realization to identifying potential areas for improvement in pricing, marketing, or inventory management.

+ Evaluate Property Performance Through Other Key Metrics: Assess additional performance indicators, including DSRN (Daily Sales Revenue per Night), DURN (Duration of Stay), and the Cancellation Rate to understand customer behavior and booking patterns, such as average length of stay, frequency of cancellations, and daily revenue generation.

+ Analyze Booking and Revenue for Each Room Type and Property Category: Break down booking trends and revenue generation across different room types (e.g., standard, deluxe, suite) and property categories (e.g., resort, city hotel) to identify which room types and categories are the most profitable and where improvements can be made to optimize revenue.

+ Identify Operational Performance of the Hotel on Weekends and Weekdays: Compare the hotel’s performance on weekends versus weekdays, analyzing differences in occupancy, ADR, and revenue generation and assess whether weekends attract more leisure travelers while weekdays cater to business travelers, and adjust marketing and pricing strategies accordingly.
